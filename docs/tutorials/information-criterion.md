# Using Information Criterion

By using an Information Criterion (IC), the user does not need to define the exact model orders, but he has to assign a **range of orders** and let the IC find the best combination of orders.

When an input-output model structure of linear or nonlinear type is selected, the information criteria are possible only for SISO systems.
